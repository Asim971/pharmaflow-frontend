- Bengali language localization support? ✓
- Pharmaceutical accessibility standards compliance? ✓

**Technical Requirements**:
- TypeScript for pharmaceutical type safety? ✓
- Component library with pharmaceutical design patterns? ✓
- API integration with existing backend? ✓
- Authentication integration with JWT? ✓
- Real-time updates for pharmaceutical workflows? ✓
- Performance optimization for Bangladesh internet conditions? ✓
- Security compliance for pharmaceutical data? ✓

## Architecture Decisions

### Component Architecture
```typescript
// Pharmaceutical Component Hierarchy
interface ComponentArchitecture {
  layout: "Pharmaceutical app shell with DGDA branding",
  pages: "Feature-based routing with pharmaceutical workflows",
  components: "Atomic design with pharmaceutical specificity",
  forms: "DGDA compliance validation with audit trails",
  charts: "Pharmaceutical analytics with territory insights",
  mobile: "Shared components with platform-specific adaptations"
}
```

### State Management Strategy
```typescript
// Redux Toolkit for Pharmaceutical Data
interface StateManagement {
  auth: "JWT authentication with pharmaceutical roles",
  customers: "Customer hierarchy with territory management",
  compliance: "DGDA submissions and audit trail state",
  marketing: "Pharmaceutical campaign and performance data",
  territory: "Geographic and regulatory territory management",
  offline: "Pharmaceutical field team offline synchronization"
}
```

### API Integration Pattern
```typescript
// RTK Query for Pharmaceutical API Integration
interface APIIntegration {
  baseQuery: "Authenticated requests with pharmaceutical context",
  endpoints: "Type-safe pharmaceutical API endpoints",
  caching: "Pharmaceutical data optimization and invalidation",
  realtime: "WebSocket integration for live pharmaceutical updates",
  offline: "Queue and sync for pharmaceutical field operations"
}
```
